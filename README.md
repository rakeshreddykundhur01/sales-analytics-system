**Prerequisites**



Python 3.8+



requests library



Install dependencies using:



pip install -r requirements.txt



**How to Run**



1.Clone or download the repository:



git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-analytics-system.git

cd sales-analytics-system





2.Run the main application:



python main.py





3.Workflow:



* Reads and cleans sales data (data/sales\_data.txt)



* Validates and optionally filters transactions



* Performs analyses:



&nbsp;	Total Revenue



&nbsp;	Region-wise Sales



&nbsp;	Top Selling Products



&nbsp;	Customer Purchase Analysis



&nbsp;	Daily Sales Trend



&nbsp;	Peak Sales Day



&nbsp;	Low Performing Products



* Fetches product data from DummyJSON API



* Enriches sales data with API info (data/enriched\_sales\_data.txt)



* Generates a comprehensive report (output/sales\_report.txt)





**Output Files**



1.Enriched Sales Data:

data/enriched\_sales\_data.txt — original transactions enriched with API information



2\.Sales Report:

output/sales\_report.txt — formatted report with:



* Overall summary



* Region-wise performance



* Top 5 products and customers



* Daily sales trends



* Product performance analysis



* API enrichment summary



**Features**



* Handles non-UTF-8 encoded files



* Cleans messy sales data (commas, invalid rows, zero/negative quantities)



* Performs data validation and optional filtering



* Calculates revenue, sales, and purchase patterns



* Identifies top and low performing products



* Enriches transactions using DummyJSON API



* Generates a professional report in text format



* Includes error handling to avoid crashes





**Notes**



Ensure data/sales\_data.txt exists before running main.py



The report and enriched files are auto-generated



Default API limit is 100 products (DummyJSON)
